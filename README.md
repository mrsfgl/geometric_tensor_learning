# Geometric Tensor Learning
Development of Geometric Tensor Learning Framework

There are currently 2 directions of optimization for GeoTL:
1. __Gradient based:__ The notebook for this is named `geo_tensor_learning_gradient_based.ipynb` and is currently out-of-date. There are numerical errors for gradient computation.
2. __Non-Gradient based:__ The notebook for this is currently named `scratch.ipynb`. When the model runs smoothly, it will later be rewritten as a `class`.

There is also an implementation of `HoRPCA`, from the paper of [Golfarb and Qin, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6182) in `horpca.ipynb` for comparisons.
